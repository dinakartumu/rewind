MCP server for the [Rewind](https://rewind.rest) personal data API. Gives AI assistants access to your listening, running, watching, collecting, and reading data.

Full reference: [docs.rewind.rest/mcp-server](https://docs.rewind.rest/mcp-server).

## Setup

### Desktop apps

Add to your MCP client config (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rewind": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "rewind-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "REWIND_API_KEY": "rw_live_your_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Mobile and web

Add as a remote integration in your client's settings:

- **URL**: `https://mcp.rewind.rest/mcp`
- **Authorization**: `Bearer rw_live_your_key_here`

<details>
<summary>Claude Code</summary>

```bash
claude mcp add rewind -- npx -y rewind-mcp-server
```

</details>

Requires a [Rewind API key](https://docs.rewind.rest/authentication). `REWIND_API_URL` defaults to `https://api.rewind.rest`.

## Tools

| Domain           | Source           | Tools                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Listening**    | Last.fm          | Now playing, recent scrobbles, stats, top artists/albums/tracks, streaks, artist and album details, genre breakdown over time   |
| **Running**      | Strava           | Stats, recent runs, personal records, streaks, activity details, per-mile splits, per-year summaries                            |
| **Watching**     | Plex, Letterboxd | Recent watches, movie details, browse by genre/decade/director, stats, genre/decade/director breakdowns                         |
| **Collecting**   | Discogs, Trakt   | Vinyl collection, physical media, collection and media stats                                                                    |
| **Reading**      | Instapaper       | Recent articles, highlights, random highlight, stats, semantic similar-article recall via `find_similar_articles`               |
| **Cross-domain** | All              | Full-text search with keyword/semantic/hybrid modes, dedicated `semantic_search` for reading, unified feed, on-this-day, health |

Tool responses include images, click-through resource links, and structured JSON. Pass `include_images: false` to keep responses compact.

On clients that support [MCP Apps](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/2026-01-26-mcp-apps/) (Claude Desktop, Claude web, VS Code Copilot, Goose), `get_recent_watches`, `get_recent_reads`, `get_top_albums`, and `get_top_artists` render interactive grids inline; other clients see the standard text + image response.

## Example queries

- "What albums have I been listening to the most recently?"
- "Compare my mile splits from this month vs last month"
- "When was the last time I watched a film by Wes Anderson?"
- "What Beastie Boys records are missing from my vinyl collection?"
- "How many articles did I read last year and stack-rank the top 10 sources"
- "Can you give me a quick summary of everything I did last week?"

## Prompts

Slash-command prompts that orchestrate multiple tools: `weekly-summary`, `year-in-review`, `compare-periods`, `letterboxd-review-draft`, `training-report`, `film-diet`, `find-article`. See the [docs](https://docs.rewind.rest/mcp-server) for argument shapes.

## Authentication

Desktop apps use the `REWIND_API_KEY` env var passed to the server process; the server uses it as a Bearer token to the Rewind API.

Mobile and web clients connect to `mcp.rewind.rest` and authenticate via OAuth 2.1 with GitHub as the identity provider (1h access tokens, 90d refresh, PKCE S256).

The server is **read-only**. No write or admin operations are exposed.
